# Blackjack-in-Java
Program that allows a human user to play a simplified version of Blackjack against a computer opponent. The rules are as follows:

- Don't worry about suits or face cards; "cards" will have values from 2-11, and all values are equally likely (that is, unlike a real blackjack game, there's no greater chance of drawing a card with value 10).
- Draw two cards for the player and display them.
- Draw two cards for the "dealer" and display one of them, keeping the other one hidden.
- Allow the player to "hit" as many times as he would like.
- If the player "busts" (gets a total over 21), the dealer automatically wins.
- Allow the dealer to hit as many times as he would like. Dealer should probably hit on sixteen or lower.
- If the dealer busts, the player automatically wins.
- Assuming no one has busted, the player with the highest total wins. Dealer wins all ties.
